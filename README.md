# Influenza Analysis
Workflow for analysing influenza viral 5' end sequencing data. This code accompanies the article "[Sequencing the cap-snatching repertoire of H1N1 influenza provides insight into the mechanism of viral transcription initiation](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fnar%2Fgkv333)". 

`prime-and-realign/` contains standalone scripts that can be called on the command line. The rest of the repository is integrated with the Makefile for a continuous workflow.
